When developing code in VS Code, you may encounter the error:

`launch: program 'c:\build\Debug\outDebug' does not exist`

as shown in the figure below.

Following the hint, we can open the `launch.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "C/C++ Runner: Debug Session",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "externalConsole": true,
      "cwd": "c:/Users/13967/Desktop/c/output",
      "program": "c:/Users/13967/Desktop/c/output/build/Debug/outDebug/",
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "gdb",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

After checking carefully, the issue comes from the `program` field:

```json
"program": "c:/Users/13967/Desktop/c/output/build/Debug/outDebug/",
```

This path points to a general location, but it is not precise enough.

As shown, all my compiled C program executables are stored in:

`C:\Users\13967\Desktop\c\output`

instead of

`c:/Users/13967/Desktop/c/output/build/Debug/outDebug/` defined in `launch.json`.

### Solution

We need to **set the file path to the actual folder where the compiled C executables are stored on your computer**. Then append

```
"${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe"
```

to locate the specific `.exe` program being debugged.

For example, on my computer, the corrected setting is:

```json
"program": "c:/Users/13967/Desktop/c/output/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe"
```

Now the problem is solved! The program can be executed, breakpoints can be set, and debugging works as expected.
