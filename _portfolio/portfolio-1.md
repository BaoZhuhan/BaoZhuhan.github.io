**Awesome-SE-Box** is a long-term project for systematically archiving and reorganizing core Software Engineering course materials. It is designed for both current students and self-learners, emphasizing **structure, reusability, and searchability**. The repository covers lecture notes, assignments, and example code for C/C++, Java, Python, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with explanatory documentation and suggested learning paths for each course module. Semantic versioning and periodic releases allow students and instructors to reference or reuse specific stages of the content.

- Repository: <https://github.com/BaoZhuhan/Awesome-SE-Box>  
- Content Focus: C / C++ / Java / Python / HTML-CSS-JS / HZCU course resources  
- Releases: Packaged by course or topic (e.g., *v2.0.0-DataStructure*) for stable reference and teaching distribution.

**My Contribution**  
I consolidated scattered course materials with a consistent hierarchy (Course → Module → Assignment → Code/Notes), added navigation in README, and included instructions on usage. Key assignments and experiments have runnable examples and edge-case tests to enhance reusability and reduce academic risks. Future improvements include test scripts, solution indices, and enhanced learning path recommendations.
