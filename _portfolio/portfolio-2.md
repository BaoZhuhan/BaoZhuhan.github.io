**DingDingBookStore** is a web application project I completed in my second year as part of the B/S architecture application development course. It also serves as an example website for the course, inspired by the book [*HTML5 + CSS3 + ES6 Front-end Development Project Practice*](http://www.tup.tsinghua.edu.cn/bookscenter/book_09381201.html) authored by *Mr. Shumin Zhang*. The project emphasizes structured page layout, interactive design, and front-end development best practices.  

The system includes book browsing, category management, shopping cart functionality, and dynamic content such as rotating image banners. I implemented multiple HTML pages (`index.html`, `ebook.html`, `cart.html`, `template.html`, `contact1.html`) with CSS3 (flex and grid) and ES6 scripts to handle interactivity, including drag-and-drop for the shopping cart and dynamic content updates.  

- Online Demo: <https://baozhuhan.github.io/DingDingBookStore/>  
- Repository: <https://github.com/BaoZhuhan/DingDingBookStore>  
- Key Features: Multi-page structure, category navigation, shopping cart, dynamic content, interactive UI  
- Technology Stack: HTML5, CSS3, ES6, B/S architecture  

**My Contribution**  
I designed and implemented the full front-end architecture, including page layout, CSS styling, and interactive scripts. I systematically organized versions from initial structure to final enhancements (v2.2 → v20.7.0), added user interface improvements, implemented dynamic features such as rotating banners and shopping cart interactions, and ensured a consistent, reusable design framework for learning and demonstration purposes.
