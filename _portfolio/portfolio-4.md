**MediaCrawler** is an open-source project designed for **learning and research purposes** to crawl public social media data from multiple platforms, including Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Kuaishou, Bilibili, Weibo, Tieba, and Zhihu. The project demonstrates practical browser automation using **Playwright**, preserving login sessions to obtain necessary data without reverse-engineering complex JavaScript encryption.

Key functionalities include:

- Keyword-based search and specific post ID crawling  
- Crawling secondary comments and creator homepages  
- Login state caching and IP proxy support  
- Data export to SQLite, MySQL, CSV, or JSON  
- Generating comment word clouds for analytics  

The project emphasizes learning **modern web scraping architecture**, with a **MediaCrawlerPro version** providing advanced features like multi-account support, resume crawling, Linux compatibility, and decoupled JS signature logic for enterprise-level code quality.
