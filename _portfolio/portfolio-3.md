**BSfinal** is the final project of the B/S Architecture Application Development course at HZCU, representing a fictional online platform for *Jingzhou City TCM Hospital*. The website aims to provide patients, medical staff, and the public with comprehensive hospital information, including homepage, department navigation pages, and detailed department pages such as "Famous Doctors Garden". The platform emphasizes responsive design, user-friendly navigation, and interactive features to simulate a real-world healthcare web application.  

Key functionalities include department browsing, doctor listings with 3D flip cards, news modules, interactive comment submission, rotating banner ads, and real-time clocks. Layouts leverage **CSS Grid** for overall page structure and **Flexbox** for header, footer, and module alignment, ensuring a responsive and visually clean design. JavaScript is used to implement dynamic interactions such as carousels, comment submissions, and real-time updates.

- Technology Stack: HTML5, CSS3 (Grid & Flex), JavaScript, B/S architecture  

**My Contribution**  
I designed and implemented the full front-end structure, including layout, styling, and interactivity. I implemented multiple pages (`index.html`, `module.html`, `detail.html`) with responsive grid and flex layouts, interactive JavaScript modules for carousel, clock, and comment submission, and 3D flip cards for doctor info. I also ensured consistent visual design, usability for multiple user types, and systematic code organization, achieving a polished and functional hospital web platform. The project received a final score of **93/100** and serves as a comprehensive example of B/S web development skills.
