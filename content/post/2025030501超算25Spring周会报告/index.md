## GPU Operator Kernel Development, Performance Optimization & CUDA Programming

1. C/C++ and Operating System Principles (no specific focus)
2. Computer Architecture and Parallel Computing Concepts (the CMU-15-418 course)
3. Integration with Deep Learning?
    - Explore how to write custom CUDA Kernels to accelerate certain operators in deep learning, such as convolution, normalization, or other common operations.
    - Attempt to integrate custom CUDA Kernels in PyTorch, and understand how the framework calls acceleration code at the lower level.

## Deep Learning Algorithm Principles and PyTorch Direction

1. Get started with PyTorch and complete the official tutorial examples.
2. Begin intermediate-level projects, such as image classification or simple object detection tasks; try customizing model layers and parameter tuning.
3. Study cutting-edge research papers, design a comprehensive project (国创), combining data preprocessing, model training, and model optimization.

## Learning Path

- **First 4 weeks**：
    - **Main focus**: Learn deep learning fundamental theories; Get started with PyTorch, complete official tutorial examples.
    - **Secondary focus**: Use spare time to complete CUDA programming basics, continue with the CMU-15-418 course
- **Weeks 5-8**：
    - **Main focus**: Tasks such as image classification or simple object detection; Try customizing model layers and parameter tuning.
    - **Secondary focus**: Write simple CUDA examples, attempt to analyze performance bottlenecks, gradually understand memory optimization strategies.
- **Weeks 9-12**：
    - **Main focus**: Study cutting-edge research papers in depth, design a comprehensive project (implement and refine 国创), combining data preprocessing, model training and model optimization.
    - **Secondary focus**: Try integrating CUDA Kernels into PyTorch projects, optimize key operators, use performance analysis tools for tuning.
