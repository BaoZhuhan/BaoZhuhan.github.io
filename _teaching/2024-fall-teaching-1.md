From September 2024 to January 2025, I taught a science enrichment course titled *“Fun with Science”* for a class of about 30 elementary school students at Liangzhu Experimental School. The course introduced fundamental concepts in physics, chemistry, and solid geometry, complemented by hands-on puzzle-like experiments designed to cultivate scientific curiosity and problem-solving skills.
